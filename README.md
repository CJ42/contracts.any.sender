# Any.Sender: UI + Contract Optimisations

This is a forked repo of the contracts for [any.sender](https://github.com/PISAresearch/docs.any.sender), the accountable transaction relaying service.

I have forked the repo to use it for my personal training / learning and contribute to the project.

THe objectives for this project so far are:

- build a UI in React
- analyse + optimise the contracts (for gas cost eventually)
